🌟 About the Project

This repository contains DriveGuard, a comprehensive Driver Safety and Fleet Management System developed as part of my final year dissertation for the BSc in Computer Science degree at Technological University Dublin.

The project focuses on enhancing driver safety and improving fleet management operations by integrating real-time monitoring, drowsiness detection, trip management, and driver behavior analytics.

📱 Applications

1 Driver Mobile App

Provides drowsiness detection using the smartphone camera.

Displays assigned trips and navigation assistance.

Visualizes real-time driving metrics like speed, harsh braking, and trip count.



2️ Fleet Manager Web App

Real-time driver tracking and monitoring.

Driver behavior analysis with dashboards and statistics.

Trip creation and assignment.

👀 How to Operate

Driver App: Drivers log in to monitor their fatigue status, receive trips, and  view behavior metrics.

Fleet Manager Web App: Managers log in to track drivers, assign trips, and view behavior metrics.
