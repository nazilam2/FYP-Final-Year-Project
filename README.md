# 🌟 About the Project

This repository contains DriveGuard, a comprehensive Driver Safety and Fleet Management System developed as part of my final year project for the BSc in Computer Science degree at Technological University Dublin.

This project focuses on enhancing driver safety and improving fleet management operations by integrating real-time monitoring, drowsiness detection, trip management, and driver behavoir analytics.

# 📱 Applications

## 1️ Driver Mobile App 
Provides drowsiness detection using the smartphone camera.

Display assigned trips and navigation assistance. 

Visualizes real-time driving metrics like speed, harsh braking, and trip count, and heart rate. 

## 2️ Fleet Manager Web App 
Real-time driver tracking and monitoring.

Driver behavoir analysis with dashboards and statistics.

Trip creation and assignment. 


# 👾 Tech Stack 

## Programming Languages 
- JavaScript (for Web and Backend)

- JavaScrpt (for React Native App)

- MicroPython (for Raspberry Pi Pico programming)


### Front End:

- React.js (Web App)
- React Native (Driver Mobile App)

### Database:

- Firebase Firestore (Cloud-hosted NoSQL database)

### Server:

- Node.js with Express (API server and real-time data processing)

- MQTT Protocol (for IoT sensor data transmission)

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico (Microcontroller)

- Accelerometer (Motion and sudden impact detection)

- GPS (Real-time GPS tracking)

- Rotary Angle Sensor (Fuel level simulation)

- Heart rate sensor 


### Version Control:

- Git and GitHub (for version control and collaboration) 

# 🧰 Getting Started 

To set up the project locally:


1. Clone the Repository
   
- git clone https://github.com/nazilam2/FYP-Final-Year-Project.git
- cd FYP-Final-Year-Project

2. Start the Web App

- cd fleet_webapp

- npm install

- npm start 

3. Start the Mobile App

- cd Driver_app

- npx react-native run-android

  Note: Mobile App must be tested on a physical Android device. 



# 👀 How to Operate

Driver App: Drivers log in to monitor their fatigue status, view assigned trips, get drowsiness and coffee break alerts, and track their driving behavior. 

Fleet Manager Web App: Managers log in to assign trips, track drivers in real time, check online/offline drivers, update/delete drivers, and view driver behavior analytics.
